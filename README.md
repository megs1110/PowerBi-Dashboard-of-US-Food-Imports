# PowerBi-Dashboard-of-US-Food-Imports
This project aims to analyze and understand the import data of the United States, specifically focusing on the trends and patterns in the import of different goods from various countries.

## Data Preprocessing
The data in the excel file was transposed to easily visualize it in Power BI.
Unwanted missing rows and columns were removed.
Profiling was done in Power BI for anomaly detection, such as missing values, duplicate values, and null values.

## Patterns and Knowledge Discovery
The lowest inflation rate was -5.12% in 2009 and the highest was 7.75% in 2003.
Canada and Mexico were found to be the main exporters of live animal products, with very little contribution from the rest of the world.
Canada was found to be the largest exporter of grains, contributing more than 50% of the total value of grain imports.
Mexico was found to be the largest exporter of fruits, contributing more than 50% of the total value of fruit imports.
The USA was found to be heavily dependent on Mexico for vegetables, with Mexico contributing more than 60% of the total vegetable imports.

## Data Analytics Methods
Anomaly detection: Irregularities were found in the datasets for sheep and goats, malt beer, coffee, and dairy.
Demand forecasting for the next five years: Accurately forecasting the demand for different categories of goods will help to optimize operations, supply chain management, and inventory management. Forecasts were made for vegetable, vegetable oils, other edible products, fish and shellfish, sugar and candy, live meat animals, beverages, grains, dairy, cocoa and chocolate, meats, nuts, fruits, and coffee, tea and spices.
